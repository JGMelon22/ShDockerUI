<h3>How to use?</h3>
  
- First, make sure you have at least OpenJDK 8 and Eclipse IDE installed in your machine; <br/>
- Then move all the shell scripts to your /home directory and do not forget to give execution permition to each one with <code>chmod +x</code> command; <br/>
- Bear in mind you will probably need to rename the conatiners name from .sh files according to your needs; <br/>
- Have fun :)
