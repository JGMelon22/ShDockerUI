<h3>🛠️🚧 How to build and run?</h3> 
  
- First, make sure you have at least OpenJDK 8 and Eclipse IDE installed in your machine; <br/>
- Then move all the shell scripts to your <code>/home</code> directory and do not forget to give execution permition to each one with <code>chmod +x</code> command; <br/>
- Bear in mind two things:
	- you will probably need to rename the containers name from .sh files according to your needs; <br/>
	- by deafult, the invoked terminal it is <code>xfce-terminal</code>, so adjust according your needs (eg: <code>gnome-terminal</code> or <code>konsole</code>); <br/>
- Have fun :)
